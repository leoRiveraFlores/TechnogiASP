Technogi test for ASP.NET project

The following repository contains the ASP.NET test requested by the Technogi team.

To create this code, a basic ASP.NET MVC template was used.
The database is of type SQL and its .bak file is located in the DB folder which is in the root of the project.

Due to time constraints, the Create, Modify, Delete and Search components were created in a simple way.
